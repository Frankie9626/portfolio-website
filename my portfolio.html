            <p>Hi, I'm Frankline, an aspiring software engineer with a passion for technology and a dream of building software from scratch. My journey into software engineering has been driven by a deep interest in how technology shapes the world, and I'm committed to learning and mastering the skills needed to develop impactful solutions. With each step, I’m honing my problem-solving abilities and expanding my knowledge of various programming languages and tools.

                <strong>My Skills</strong> <br>
                As I work toward becoming a full-fledged software engineer, I am building a strong foundation in  Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I am particularly focused on understanding the full software development lifecycle, from designing user-friendly interfaces to writing clean, efficient code. My goal is to apply my passion for coding and problem-solving to create software that not only works well but also enhances the user experience.

                <strong>Projects</strong>  <br> 
                Though still early in my journey, I have already begun working on a few exciting projects that push my skills and challenge me to think creatively. From developing simple web applications to exploring more complex software concepts, each project provides me with valuable learning opportunities. I’m always eager to take on new challenges, and you can check out my progress and current work in the "Projects" section.
